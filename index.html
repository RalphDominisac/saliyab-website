        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          We began as an internal learning session within Mugna Technologies,
          where each member of the team had the opportunity to share their knowledge
          and expertise with their colleagues. As we continued to learn and grow
          together, we realized the potential for Saliyab to become a valuable resource
          for the wider tech community.

          <h2>What is Saliyab?</h2>
          <p>
            "Saliyab" is a Bisaya word which translates in English as 
            Scatter, Spread. Saliyab is a knowledge-sharing platform and
            workshop series that focuses on technology and innovation. 
            It was founded as an internal learning session within Mugna
            Technologies and now open to the wider tech community. In 2022,
            Mugna opened Saliyab to the public. Our goal is to provide a
            space for technical and creative discussion, where people from
            all backgrounds and skill levels can come together to learn and 
            share their knowledge.

            Saliyab's workshop was a game-changer for me. 
            The insights and practical advice I gained from 
            the experts in the field helped me to take my skills
            to the next level and make a real impact in my work.
            I highly recommend it!

            I've attended several workshops in the past, 
            but Saliyab's was by far the most informative
            and engaging. The speakers were knowledgeable and 
            approachable, and I left feeling motivated and inspired 
            to pursue new opportunities in the tech industry.

            The Saliyab workshop provided me with a wealth

            hands-on approach and the chance to network with 
            other professionals in the field.

            As a beginner in the tech industry,

            But I'm so glad I did! The workshop was tailored to all 
            skill levels and I left with a much deeper understanding 
            of the field and its possibilities.
